# Part 2 — From Simulated Traffic to Real Model Calls

> **Reader path:** [LinkedIn post](../linkedin/02-simulation-to-real-models.md) → this design → [code-and-test traceability](../TRACEABILITY.md#publication-traceability)

## In plain terms

**Example.** A KYC assistant calls an AI model to summarise a customer file.
Agent Sentinel records the call, what model answered and which agent asked,
after masking sensitive values like emails and card numbers on a best-effort
basis. If Agent Sentinel is briefly unreachable, the assistant carries on
working; the recording gap is logged locally so operators can see it.

**Why it matters.** This is the difference between a monitoring tool your
operations team trusts and one they quietly work around. A monitoring system
that can take down production the moment it hiccups is worse than a brief
recording gap. Prove it on safe data first, then let it watch real traffic,
and never let it become the reason a critical process stops.

## Business value

**What it adds.**

- **Works with the AI providers you already use.** Real calls to Azure OpenAI
  and Anthropic are recorded without changing what the agent does.
- **Monitoring never takes the agent down.** If recording fails, the agent's
  work still completes, and the gap is visible rather than silent.
- **Less sensitive data in the evidence.** Obvious personal and card data is
  masked before the record leaves the agent.

**In one line.** Real AI model calls, recorded without putting the agent at
risk.

**What it doesn't do (yet).** It sees only calls made through the supported
providers' wrappers, masking is best-effort rather than a guarantee, and
warning or blocking modes are roadmap.

## Design and implementation

Phase 1 proves the core idea with simulated fintech traffic, deterministic policy checks, DuckDB storage, and a local dashboard. Phase 2 then swaps simulation for real Azure OpenAI / Anthropic calls without changing the core loop.

| Capability | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Event simulation | [`examples/phase1/fintech_sim/sim.py`](../../../examples/phase1/fintech_sim/sim.py) creates realistic fintech network traffic |
| Policy-as-code | [`policies/fintech.yaml`](../../../policies/fintech.yaml) defines allowed hosts, tools, models, bytes, and controls |
| Normalization | `parse_flow()` converts raw traffic into one `AgentEvent` schema |
| Detection | Rules catch unapproved hosts, tools, models, oversize egress, and rate violations |
| Evidence | Findings include title, rule, severity, explanation, evidence, and control refs |
| Storage | DuckDB tables: `events` and `findings` |
| UX | Local CISO board with severity cards, charts, filters, evidence drawer, event feed |

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| 1 | Sends the real call to Azure OpenAI or Anthropic |
| 2 | Applies best-effort sensitive-field/pattern redaction before transport |
| 3 | Posts to authenticated `POST /ingest` when a token/token-provider is configured |
| 4 | Records model-proposed tools as `TOOL_REQUESTED`; execution requires tool/MCP instrumentation |

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`app/sentinel/collector/sdk_base.py`](../../../app/sentinel/collector/sdk_base.py) | Shared fail-open HTTP reporter |
| [`app/sentinel/collector/redaction.py`](../../../app/sentinel/collector/redaction.py) | Best-effort edge redaction; not a proof that arbitrary free text contains no sensitive data |
| [`app/sentinel/collector/azure_openai.py`](../../../app/sentinel/collector/azure_openai.py) | Azure OpenAI wrapper |
| [`app/sentinel/collector/anthropic_sdk.py`](../../../app/sentinel/collector/anthropic_sdk.py) | Anthropic wrapper |
| [`examples/phase2/azure_agent.py`](../../../examples/phase2/azure_agent.py) | Azure OpenAI example agent |
| [`examples/phase2/anthropic_agent.py`](../../../examples/phase2/anthropic_agent.py) | Anthropic example agent |
| [`examples/phase2/.env.example`](../../../examples/phase2/.env.example) | Environment variable template, including `SENTINEL_AUTH_TOKEN` |
| [`start_phase2.sh`](../../../start_phase2.sh) | One-command Phase 2 launcher |

#### Why fail open first?

For early observability, Sentinel should not break production agents if the collector is temporarily unavailable.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Agent calls model"] --> B{"Sentinel reachable?"}
    B -->|"Yes"| C["Send telemetry to /ingest"]
    B -->|"No"| D["Log bounded local warning"]
    C --> E["Return model response"]
    D --> E
```

Only Observe is implemented in this path today. The remaining modes are roadmap:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Observe | **Current** — call model, then report; reporting failure logs and returns `{}` |
| Warn | **Roadmap** — explicit operator-facing delivery/coverage alerts |
| Block | **Roadmap** — pre-call gateway required |
| Quarantine | **Roadmap** — external control-plane integration required |
